# Lyx-file-automation

A Lot of researchers use stata data in writing their research articles.It is frustrating to manually update the stata data in their 
articles everytime the data changes.
This is an attempt to automatically update the data in article using Python.
The stata output is stored in text_folder.
The data extracted from it is stored in output_folder.
The data in output_folder is refernced in text.lyx file.
The command to run the file :
automation.py <Pth to text_folder> <Path to output_folder>
